/* 
  Local clone shim CSS
  --------------------
  The pages in this repo are a static snapshot of the live Framer site markup.
  Framer SSR already includes a large amount of inline CSS in each HTML file.

  We keep this file intentionally small and focused on:
  - Consistent base defaults across static hosts
  - Fixes for common static-host quirks (e.g., missing smooth scrolling)
  - A safe place for any future tweaks without editing the Framer-generated blocks

html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

/* Prefer Framer's own focus styles, but ensure something is visible in case a host injects CSS. */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid currentColor;
  outline-offset: 3px;
