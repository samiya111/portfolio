    Vercel static config for the cloned portfolio.

    Why this is simple:
    - This project is a fully static export (plain HTML/CSS/JS).
    - Each route already has a real HTML file (e.g. `/projects/nhs/index.html`),
      so Vercel can serve deep links directly without special rewrites.
    - We don't override that behaviour to avoid fighting with Framer's own
      client-side routing.

    On the Vercel dashboard, choose:
    - Framework preset: "Other"
    - Output directory: "."
